        The clusters of accessory shell and cloud genes form the region of genome plasticity (RGP) primarily originating from horizontal gene transfer events. These RGPs can be grouped into specific insertion spots based on the presence of conserved flanking persistent genes.

        We identified 26 hotspots in <i>Salmonella</i>. Visualise the gene content of the spots and the RGPs with our interactive HTML files.
